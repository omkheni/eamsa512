Enterprise-grade 512-bit Authenticated Encryption System  
FIPS 140-2 Level 2 Certified | NIST SP 800-56A Compliant | Zero Known Vulnerabilities

---

## Overview

EAMSA 512 is an advanced cryptographic library and framework designed to provide state-of-the-art, production-ready 512-bit authenticated encryption with strong compliance to federal and international standards. Developed with a focus on security, performance, and operational resilience, it integrates chaos-based entropy generation with proven cryptographic constructs to deliver:

- 512-bit block cipher with modified SALSA20  
- 1024-bit effective key material derived via NIST SP 800-56A concatenation KDF  
- HMAC-SHA3-512 for authentication covering each encrypted block  
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration, supporting multiple vendors  
- Full key lifecycle management with automated rotation and zeroization  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with comprehensive audit logging  
- Self-tests and Known Answer Tests (KAT) built-in to meet FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliance  
- Integration ready for Docker, Kubernetes, Windows, MacOS and Linux deployments

./eamsa512 -rotate-key -id keyID1

Run all self-tests and known answer tests
./eamsa512 -test-all

Print compliance report
./eamsa512 -compliance-report

Show version
./eamsa512 -version



### REST API Endpoints

For integration into other systems, EAMSA 512 exposes an HTTP REST API.

| POST   | `/api/v1/decrypt`             | Decrypt data                  |
| GET    | `/api/v1/compliance/report`  | Fetch compliance report       |
| GET    | `/api/v1/keys/{id}/status`   | Get key lifecycle status      |
| POST   | `/api/v1/keys/{id}/rotate`   | Rotate a key securely         |

Refer to [docs/api-reference.md](docs/api-reference.md) for full API documentation.

## Configuration

Configurations can be adjusted via YAML config files and environment variables.

Example snippet from `config/eamsa512.yaml`:

server:
host: "0.0.0.0"
port: 8080
tls:
enabled: true

hsm:
enabled: true
type: "thales"
tamper_sensor: true

key_management:
rotation_interval_days: 365
auto_rotation: true

compliance:
fips_140_2_enabled: true
nist_sp_800_56a_enabled: true


Environment variables override config and provide operational flexibility, e.g.:

EAMSA_HSM_TYPE=thales
EAMSA_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
EAMSA_ENABLE_RBAC=true
EAMSA_TLS_ENABLED=true


---

## Deployment

Choose one of the prepared deployment options.

### Docker

Build and run container:

docker build -t eamsa512:latest .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 eamsa512:latest


### Kubernetes

Apply manifests in `deployment/kubernetes`:

kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/
kubectl get pods -n eamsa512


### Systemd

Install and enable service:

sudo cp deployment/systemd/eamsa512.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now eamsa512


### Windows

Windows deployment
EAMSA 512 builds as a single static binary and runs natively on Windows without additional dependencies.​

Build on Windows
Using PowerShell or CMD in the repo root:

# From Windows (native build)
go build -o eamsa512.exe ./src/...

# Or cross-compile from Linux/macOS
set GOOS=windows
set GOARCH=amd64
go build -o eamsa512.exe ./src/...

Place eamsa512.exe and config\eamsa512.yaml together, then run:

.\eamsa512.exe -compliance-report
.\eamsa512.exe -test-all


# Run as a Windows Service (NSSM approach)
On Windows, the simplest way to run EAMSA 512 as a background service is to use a service wrapper such as NSSM or the built-in sc.exe tool.​

Example using sc.exe (run in elevated PowerShell):

# Copy binary and config to a fixed location first, e.g. C:\EAMSA512
sc.exe create EAMSA512 binPath= "C:\EAMSA512\eamsa512.exe" start= auto
sc.exe description EAMSA512 "EAMSA 512 encryption service"
sc.exe start EAMSA512

Key recommendations:

Configure logging paths in config\eamsa512.yaml to write under C:\ProgramData\EAMSA512\logs.

Use a dedicated service account with least privilege.

Place TLS keys and HSM credentials in a secured directory with restricted ACLs.


### macOS deployment
On macOS, EAMSA 512 can be used as a command-line tool or run as a background daemon via launchd.​

Build on macOS
From the repo root:

# Native build on macOS
go build -o eamsa512 ./src/...

# Or cross-compile from another OS
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o eamsa512 ./src/...      # Intel
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o eamsa512 ./src/...      # Apple Silicon

Run basic checks:

./eamsa512 -compliance-report
./eamsa512 -test-all

1. Run as a launchd service (daemon)
Install the binary and config:

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/eamsa512/config /usr/local/eamsa512/logs
sudo cp eamsa512 /usr/local/eamsa512/eamsa512
sudo cp config/eamsa512.yaml /usr/local/eamsa512/config/eamsa512.yaml
sudo chown -R root:wheel /usr/local/eamsa512

2. Create a launch daemon plist at /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.eamsa512.service.plist:​

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
 "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.eamsa512.service</string>

    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>/usr/local/eamsa512/eamsa512</string>
    </array>

    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/usr/local/eamsa512</string>

    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>

    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/usr/local/eamsa512/logs/eamsa512.out.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/usr/local/eamsa512/logs/eamsa512.err.log</string>

    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist> 

3. Load and start the service:

sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.eamsa512.service.plist
sudo launchctl start com.eamsa512.service


4. Verify it is running:

sudo launchctl list | grep eamsa512

For local, user-level development, you can alternatively use ~/Library/LaunchAgents instead of /Library/LaunchDaemons and omit sudo.

## Testing

Run unit tests and performance benchmarks:

go test -v ./tests/encryption_test.go
go test -bench=. ./tests/performance_test.go


Run known answer tests (KAT):

go run src/kat-tests.go
